This is especially important if fit_mean is false\nfrequencies: the frequecy grid (not angular frequencies) at which the periodogram will be computed, as a vector.  If not provided, it is an evenly spaced grid of type Range, automatically determined with LombScargle.autofrequency function, which see.  See below for other available keywords that can be used to affect the frequency grid without directly setting frequencies\n\nYou can explicitely require to use or not the fast method by Press & Rybicki, overriding the default choice, by setting the fast keyword.  In any case, frequencies must be a Range object (this is the default) in order to actually use this method.

Passing FFTW.MEASURE or FFTW.PATIENT will instead spend several seconds (or more) benchmarking different possible FFT algorithms and picking the fastest one; see the FFTW manual for more information on planner flags.\ntimelimit: specifies a rough upper bound on the allowed planning time, in seconds.\noversampling: oversampling the frequency factor for the approximation; roughly the number of time samples across the highest-frequency sinusoid. This parameter contains the tradeoff between accuracy and speed.\npadding_factors: the FFT is performed on a vector with length equal to the smallest number larger than or equal to N * oversampling which is a product of all numbers in this vector.  E.g., use padding_factors=[2] to perform the FFT on a vector padded to a power of 2, or padding_factors=[2, 3, 5, 7] for the optimal size for the FFTW library.\nMfft: the number of adjacent points to use in the FFT approximation.\n\nIn addition, you can use all optional keyword arguments of LombScargle.autofrequency function in order to tune the frequencies.\n\nIf the signal has uncertainties, the signal vector can also be a vector of Measurement objects (from Measurements.jl package), in which case you don’t need to pass a separate errors vector for the uncertainties of the signal.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"#LombScargle.autofrequency","page":"LombScargle.jl","title":"LombScargle.autofrequency","text":"autofrequency(times::AbstractVector{Real};\n              samples_per_peak::Integer=5,\n              nyquist_factor::Integer=5,\n              minimum_frequency::Real=NaN,\n              maximum_frequency::Real=NaN)\n\nDetermine a suitable frequency grid for the given vector of times.\n\nOptional keyword arguments are:\n\nsamples_per_peak: the approximate number of desired samples across the typical peak\nnyquist_factor: the multiple of the average Nyquist frequency used to choose the maximum frequency if maximum_frequency is not provided\nminimum_frequency: if specified, then use this minimum frequency rather than one chosen based on the size of the baseline\nmaximum_frequency: if specified, then use this maximum frequency rather than one chosen based on the average Nyquist frequency\n\nThis is based on prescription given at https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2015/06/13/lomb-scargle-in-python/ and uses the same keywords names adopted in Astropy.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"","page":"LombScargle.jl","title":"LombScargle.jl","text":"LombScargle.plan takes all the same argument as lombscargle shown above and returns a LombScargle.PeriodogramPlan object after having pre-computed certain quantities needed afterwards, and pre-allocated the memory for the periodogram.

Secondly, the LombScargle.PeriodogramPlan bears the time vector, but the quantities that are pre-computed in planning stage do not actually depend on it. This is particularly useful if you want to calculate the False-Alarm Probability via bootstrapping with LombScargle.bootstrap: the vector time is randomly shuffled, but pre-computed quantities will remain the same, saving both time and memory in each iteration.
